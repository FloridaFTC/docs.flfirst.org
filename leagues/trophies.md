# Trophy Ordering

This document contains information about ordering League Tournament trophies for league leaders.

_FIRST_ Tech Challenge requests that all events use the official trophy provider, Sports Awards.
If you have an existing relationship with a different vendor, or an alternative method for acquiring or making trophies for your League Tournament, please consider the official request and make the best choice for your league.
Orders are placed on [their website](https://ftc.firstinspiresawards.com/).

## Decisions

Ordering trophies requires a few important decisions.
Below are some recommendations, but league leaders are entrusted to make the best choices for their league (and budget).

=== Do you want the option of giving a Judges' Choice Award?
This trophy is not included in the default “kit” (more information below).

It is **recommended** to order a trophy for this award so that your JA / Judges have the option, even if they ultimately choose not to give the award.
As a reminder, in terms of advancement points, the Judges’ Choice Award is worth just as much as other awards.

=== Do you want to give a Volunteer of the Year award?
This plaque is not included in the default "kit".
This award can be given at your league leadership’s discretion, and does not require the involvement of the judge crew.

It is **recommended** to order a plaque for this award if your leadership committee is comfortable nominating and choosing a Volunteer of the Year from your league.

=== Do you want to give out medals for the robot game winners?
The “kit” only includes medals for the Inspire Award winner.

If you want to give out individual medals for members of the winning alliance, consider ordering 20 (average 10 per team).
If a team needs more, leagues can order additional medals after the event.

=== Do you want to engrave the event name, season, or award on the medals?
By default, medals are completely blank except for a generic _FIRST_ Tech Challenge logo — no indication of the event, the season, or the award.
Engraving is $0.75 each.

It is **recommended** to engrave your (shortened) event name and “Inspire Award 2025–26” or “Winning Alliance 2025–26” as appropriate.

===

Armed with these decisions, you're ready to order.

## Make the Order

Create an account on https://ftc.firstinspiresawards.com/ to get started.
Then, choose your items:

=== (1) Leagues & Qualifiers Kit

Choose the kit size that corresponds with the size of your league.
This includes the majority of trophies, trophy plates, and medals for the Inspire Award.

- You must fill out the name of the event (for example, “Example League Tournament”).
  The official term is “League Tournament”, not “League Championship”.
- You may optionally choose to engrave the included Inspire Award medals.
  - This requires a shortened league or event name (for example, “Space Coast League” or “ORL League Tournament”).
  - Under additional engraving details, you have about 25 characters of space.
    This is enough for “Inspire Award 2025–26”.

=== (1) (Optional) Judges’ Choice Award trophy

Choose the 4x7 (medium) trophy to match the other trophies, as this award earns the same number of advancement points as the other awards.

- You must fill out the name of the event (for example, “Example League Tournament”).
  The official term is “League Tournament”, not “League Championship”.
- Select the Award Name **Judges’ Choice**.

=== (1) (Optional) Volunteer of the Year Plaque

Any size option is acceptable.

- You must fill out the name of the event (for example, “Example League Tournament”).
  The official term is “League Tournament”, not “League Championship”.
- Select the Award Name **Volunteer of the Year**.

=== (20) (Optional) Winning Alliance Medals

The 20 count is based on an estimate of 10 students per team x 2 winning alliance teams.
If you engrave the medals, they are not reusable, so you may choose to order fewer and work with winning coaches to order more after the event.
Please balance the logistics, cost, and team experience as you see fit.

- You may optionally choose to engrave the medals.
  - This requires a shortened league or event name (for example, “Space Coast League” or “ORL League Tournament”).
  - Under additional engraving details, you have about 25 characters of space. This is enough for “Winning Alliance 2025–26”.

Once you make the order, there are still two important tasks.

## Proofs and Inspection

After submitting the order, Sports Awards will send an email with proofs that must be approved before the order continues.

!!!danger Important
You should review the proofs very carefully within 24 hours.
Check all of the details, and especially:

- Ensure all awards are present in the trophy plates
- Ensure the spelling of the event is correct
- Ensure the program name is correctly capitalized and italicized: "_FIRST_ Tech Challenge"

Note that Sports Awards may provide duplicate trophy plates in the proofs.
!!!

After receiving the order, please perform a similarly thorough inspection.
If there are any issues, please contact Sports Awards and copy the Program Delivery Partner.
