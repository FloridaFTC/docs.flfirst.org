## _The Short Version_

- Coaches nominate students
- Leagues recruit _Dean's List Interviewers_
- Interviewers interview nominees and submit notes
- Leagues recognize nominees at the League Tournament

## Nominations

Coaches can nominate up to two students, in 10th or 11th grade, for the Dean's List Award each year.
Nominations have a global deadline set by _FIRST_.
**Please encourage coaches to nominate their students.**
Share the [Dean's List Nomination Guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/hubfs/web/program/ftc/deans-list-nomination-guide.pdf?hsLang=en) for more information.

We aren't able to see any information about the nominations until after the deadline (usually at noon on the day after the deadline).
This includes the count of nominations, or how they are divided among the leagues.

!!! Nomenclature
Every nominated student is referred to as a **Dean's List Semi-Finalist**.
!!!

## Recruiting Interviewers

Individual leagues recruit **Dean's List Interviewers**.
These volunteers will, in pairs, conduct interviews with the nominated students and provide written notes about the student in the Judging Portal.
They **do** need to be unbiased individuals that are willing to advocate for each of the students, but they **do not** need to make any decisions about who "wins".

Someone interested in volunteering as a Dean’s List Interviewer should do the following:

- Review the [Dean's List Interviewer Manual](https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/volunteer/deans-list-interviewer)
- Sign up as a _Dean’s List Interviewer_ at the _Florida Dean’s List Interviews_ event in the FIRST Dashboard
  - An express signup link is available in the overview panel above
- They should ignore the dates listed for the event (more on this later)
- Make it known (by emailing me, or having you email me) which league they will interview

Each league needs at least two interviewers.
Leagues can share interviewers if someone has sufficient time.
Leagues can also recruit additional interviewers to help share the workload.

## Conducting Interviews

After the nomination deadline, the PDP will share information about the nominees.
Any time after that, interviewers can schedule interviews.
Here are the constraints:

- Interviews must be conducted during the designated timeframe listed in the overview above.
- Interview notes are due by the end of the day on the date listed.
  It’s a good practice to submit them as soon as possible after each individual interview, for the sake of memory.
- Interviews, which are usually performed via video conference, require two interviewers to be present at all times.
  Nominees may also have a silent observer present.
- If a league has more than two interviewers, they may self-organize coverage of interviews however they see fit.

The timeframe is a trade-off between giving Dean's List Interviewers as much time as possible, and giving the Dean’s List Reviewers sufficient time to review the interview notes and select finalists before their deadline.

## Recognizing Semi-Finalists

Every nominated student is considered a Semi-Finalist for the Dean’s List Award.
Leagues should recognize the Semi-Finalists at their League Tournament event.
Some portion of a script (opening or awards) will likely include this.

The PDP may receive physical pins for recognition; if this happens, league leaders will be contacted regarding shipping.
