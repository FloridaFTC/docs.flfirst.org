# Event Types

_FIRST_ Tech Challenge has several different types of events throughout the season.
This document outlines the differences between them.

## Event Registration

First, a note about event registration:
In Florida, teams register for events using Region Manager, which is accessible from the [events page](https://flfirst.org/events).

!!! Region Manager Access
In order to access Region Manager and register for an event, teams must have paid the yearly _FIRST_ registration fee.
It can take several days for a team to appear as "paid" and gain access to Region Manager after making payment.
!!!

Once a team has access to Region Manager, they still may not be able to register for certain types of events unless they are "Event Ready".

!!! Event Ready
The term **Event Ready** is a term that _FIRST_ uses to describe teams that meet a few important requirements:

- They have paid the yearly _FIRST_ registration fee,
- There are two coaches registered in the _FIRST_ dashboard, and
- Both coaches have consented to, and passed, Youth Protection Program (YPP) screening.

Teams must be Event Ready before they can attend League Meet and League Tournament events.
!!!

Coaches should consent to YPP screening as early as possible in the season to avoid registration issues.

## Kickoff

> Early September • No Matches, No Judging, Just Entertainment • RSVP via Email

Kickoff celebrations are a chance for teams to gather in-person and learn about the new _FIRST_ Tech Challenge game together.
Here in Florida, we traditionally host a live stream for all teams that includes the official _FIRST_ video announcing the game and reviewing important updates for the season.
The best way to experience this broadcast is at your local league's kickoff gathering!

All current and prospective teams are invited to attend.

!!! Kickoff Registration
Because kickoff occurs before many teams have had a chance to finish registration with _FIRST_, these events do not require registration via Region Manager.
Instead, individual kickoff hosts will ask for RSVP via email or a similar method.
!!!

## Scrimmages

> October • Matches, No Judging • Registration via Region Manager or Email

Some leagues host scrimmage events for teams to test out their designs early in the season.
These events are **non-ranking**, **non-advancing** events, meaning they have no effect on league rankings or advancement to higher levels of tournament.
Most scrimmages are relaxed events — teams can attend without having a working robot — where a field is available for test matches.

Although scrimmages are not officially tied to a league in _FIRST_'s eyes, most scrimmages in Florida invite teams from a particular league for capacity planning purposes.

!!! Scrimmage Registration
Teams do not need to complete registration and payment with _FIRST_ to attend a scrimmage, and they do not need to be "Event Ready".

If a team has not completed payment with _FIRST_ — and therefore does not have access to Region Manager to complete event registration — they should email their league leaders or the scrimmage host and request to attend.
!!!

## League Meets

> Late October – Early January • "Event Ready" Required • Matches, no Judging • Registration via Region Manager

League Meets are **ranking** events where teams accumulate a league ranking by playing matches.
These events **do** have matches, but **do not** have structured interviews or other forms of judging.

All teams from a league are invited to each League Meet, however the team capacity may be capped by the host.
Teams do not need to attend every League Meet, but are encouraged to.

!!! League Meet Registration
Teams must be "Event Ready" to attend a League Meet event.
Registration occurs via Region Manager, and is only open to Event Ready teams.
!!!

## League Tournament

> Late January – Early February • "Event Ready" Required • Matches and Judging • Registration via Region Manager

League Tournament events are the capstone events for a league.
Here, teams compete in qualification matches and playoff rounds.
They also participate in structured interviews to receive judged awards.

All teams from a league are invited to the League Tournament.
Teams enter the tournament with league rankings accumulated from prior League Meet events, but teams can attend even if they did not attend any of the prior League Meets.

!!! League Tournament Registration
Teams must be "Event Ready" to attend a League Tournament event.
Registration occurs via Region Manager, and is only open to Event Ready teams.
!!!

## Florida Championship

> Early March • Advancing Teams • Matches and Judging • Registration via Email

Top teams (according to the advancement model described in [Section 4 of the Competition Manual](https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/game/manual-04)) from each League Tournament receive an invitation to the Florida Championship.
This dual-division event features qualification matches, playoff rounds, and judged awards.

Because attendance at this event is determined by advancement from League Tournaments, registration is handled via email after official results are posted from each League Tournament.

Top teams from this event advance to the _FIRST_ Championship event and Premier Events around the world.
