# Event Checklist

Are you ready for your next **League Meet** or **League Tournament** event?
Run through this checklist to make sure.

!!!
Kickoff, Scrimmage, and other types of events have different requirements.
See [Event Types](./event-types.md) for more information.
!!!

## 1. Be "Event Ready"

The term **Event Ready** is a term that _FIRST_ uses to describe teams that meet a few important requirements:

- They have paid the yearly _FIRST_ registration fee,
- There are **two coaches registered** in the _FIRST_ dashboard, and
- **Both** coaches have consented to, and passed, Youth Protection Program (YPP) screening.

Teams must be Event Ready before they can attend League Meet and League Tournament events.

!!!
Coaches should consent to YPP screening as early as possible in the season to avoid registration issues.
It can take some time to finish screening — meanwhile, you won't be able to register for events.
!!!

## 2. Register on Region Manager

Event hosts rely on your registration to plan their events.

!!!
In order to access Region Manager and register for an event, teams must have paid the yearly _FIRST_ registration fee.
League Meet and League Tournament registration is disallowed if a team is not "Event Ready".

It can take several days for a team to appear as "paid" and gain access to Region Manager after making payment.
Contact the Program Delivery Partner if a completed payment is not reflected.
!!!

In Florida, teams register for events using [Region Manager](https://ftcregion.com), which is accessible from the [events page](https://flfirst.org/events).
It’s separate from the FIRST Dashboard where you complete FIRST registration and add youth participants.

You’ll need to create a separate account from your _FIRST_ Dashboard account, but using the same email address as the email you provided _FIRST_ when registering your team.
This is how the system links you to your teams.

### To create an account:

1. Go to https://ftcregion.com/register
2. Fill out your name, the email address you provided _FIRST_, and a password (separate from any other login)
3. Look for a confirmation email — you won’t be able to do anything until your email address is confirmed.

If you accidentally create an account with a different email address, you can add the correct one in your account settings.

Once created, you should see all of your teams under "Teams you manage" on the dashboard.
Remember that only teams which have completed the _FIRST_ registration payment will appear here.
It may take a few days for completed payments to get synced.

### To register for an event:

1. Find the event on the Florida website (https://flfirst.org/events) or directly in Region Manager (https://ftcregion.com/s/2025/r/fl/events) — it’s the same list.
   Click “register” or find the registration tab.
2. (Make sure you’re logged in to Region Manager.)
3. Your team(s) will be listed along with their current registration status.
   You can select multiple to register all at once.
4. Confirm registration.

If you need to rescind your event registration for any reason, you can do so.
Please also reach out to your league leaders to inform them.

## 3. Print Team Roster

_FIRST_ requires that all student team members are registered with signed electronic consent and release forms.

!!!
See [Youth Registration Overview](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/youth-registration) for information about registering youth participants.
Don't wait — this process can take some time.
!!!

At checkin on event day, coaches will be asked for a current, completed team roster from the team’s [_FIRST_ Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/).
This roster should show all youth participants with completed electronic Consent & Release forms.

Many events do not have access to a printer or public internet access, so it's important that coaches print their roster ahead of time.

## 4. Self-Inspect

Using the [Inspection Checklist](https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/archive/2026/event/inspection-check) as a guide, perform a self-inspection of your team's robot.

Taking this step seriously will reduce the likelihood of stressful issues on event day.
This includes:

- Ensure that the electronic self-inspect screens do not display any warnings
  - Take this opportunity to update your software
- Ensure your robot fits within the size requirements (remember: "close enough" is a recipe for trouble)
- Ensure sharp edges have been filed down

Having a coach or mentor become an expert in inspection — and volunteer as an inspector — is a strategy of high-performing teams.

## 5. Prepare Your Robot

Event day is stressful on robots.
Conditions on the field are different with four robots; defensive play and game strategies can lead to big hits and breakage.
It's important to prepare your robot:

- Read through the Best Practices of the [Robot Wiring Guide](https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/archive/2026/team/robot-wires).
  Spending an hour implementing these recommendations can change the outcome of a match on event day.
- Check for loose bolts and set screws.
- If you have access to a battery tester, test your batteries and choose the best ones for event day.

## 6. Create a Pre-Match Checklist

Event day is stressful on participants.
This stress leads to making simple mistakes and forgetting important setup steps.
The way to fight this is a pre-match checklist.

Teams should arrive at the field with a pre-match checklist containing all of the steps necessary to set up their robot and prepare for the match.
This includes:

- Anything you need to remember when placing the robot (for all potential locations you might place it)
- Anything you need to remember when powering on the robot
- Anything you need to remember when choosing and initializing a program
- Any other cues, such as untangling gamepad cables, initializing controllers, and pressing INIT.

Teams have a limited amount of time to get ready for the match, so use a checklist to move through these steps efficiently and consistently.
