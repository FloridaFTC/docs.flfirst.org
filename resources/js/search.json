This site contains information for teams and volunteers of the program.","If you're new to the program, start here:","You can see the source of this site (and suggest changes) here:","FloridaFTC/docs.flfirst.org"]}],[{"l":"Overview of the Program","p":["Whether you're new to FIRST® or just want to understand how it works in Florida, let's take a look at the program from big to small."]},{"l":"The Short Version","p":["FIRST is a global nonprofit, and FIRST Tech Challenge is one of their programs.","Florida is a FIRST Tech Challenge Region.","Florida uses a League system for advancement between events.","Most of the regular season happens in a local league, with some teams advancing to post-season events."]},{"l":"FIRST","p":["For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) is a global nonprofit that prepares young people for the future through a suite of welcoming, team-based robotics programs for ages 5-18 (K-12).","FIRST exists to prepare the young people of today for the world of tomorrow.","To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders.","The mission of FIRST is to provide life-changing robotics programs that give young people the skills, confidence, and resilience to build a better world.","To do this, they have three educational robotics programs:","FIRST® LEGO® League offers age-appropriate STEM experiences for kids ages 5-16 through playful robotics and team-based learning. Materials help guide coaches, educators, and students through a series of sessions centered around a yearly theme. The program can be run as a small team or in a classroom-like environment. *Ages vary by country.","Learn more","FIRST® Tech Challenge participants design and build a classroom-scale robot and compete in a yearly challenge. Along the way, they gain technical skills and work collaboratively to solve problems. Materials include robot build guides, game manuals, and a coach handbook to help guide the experience.","FIRST® Robotics Competition empowers and challenges students to build industrial-sized robots to play in a yearly game. As they work together to create a team identity, build a robot, and advance appreciation for STEM in their community, they learn about career opportunities and leave with lifelong skills. Materials include a standard Kit of Parts, coach and mentor guidance, and robot building and programming documentation.","We're focused on that middle program: FIRST Tech Challenge."]},{"l":"FIRST Tech Challenge","p":["Sitting between the LEGO®-based learning experiences of FIRST® LEGO® League and the industrial-sized robots of FIRST® Robotics Competition, FIRST® Tech Challenge provides a yearly challenge using classroom-scale robots. It is:","Aligned with common school years (kickoff in September, Championship in April)","Reasonable to do in a classroom environment (robots up to 18in. cubed)","Accessible to middle- and high-school students","Despite being smaller in size, FIRST Tech Challenge participants solve real engineering problems using a broad set of materials. Beyond STEM skills, students can also gain experience with financial planning, marketing, fundraising, and communication.","FIRST Tech Challenge charges a $325 registration fee for teams each season. Teams are required to have two registered coaches who consent to background screening each year."]},{"l":"Florida FIRST Tech Challenge","p":["FIRST Tech Challenge divides the world into Regions for the purpose of competition. These regions often align with states, provinces, or countries. In our case, the state of Florida in the United States is a Region.","FIRST works with the Orlando Robotics Foundation, a local nonprofit organization, as the Program Delivery Organization for FIRST Tech Challenge in Florida. Every Program Delivery Organization names an individual Program Delivery Partner to serve as the primary point of contact for the program.","AJ Foster afoster@firstpartners.org","Orlando Robotics Foundation PO Box 781291, Orlando, FL 32829","If you have any questions about FIRST Tech Challenge in Florida, finding a team, or starting one of your own, start with an email to the Program Delivery Partner."]},{"l":"Leagues","p":["In Florida, we further divide the region geographically into Leagues. Similar to high school athletics, teams begin the season with local events that include neighboring teams. As they participate in League Meets, teams accumulate a ranking. At the league’s capstone League Tournament event, teams play additional matches, enter into playoff rounds, and participate in a judging process for judged awards. High-performing teams from the League Tournament will advance to the Florida Championship.","Each league is an informal entity led by a volunteer league leadership committee. They plan events in their area and perform the majority of communication with teams and volunteers throughout the year. Often, leagues partner with an affiliate nonprofit organization to help manage their finances.","Separate from the FIRST Tech Challenge registration fee, leagues charge an annual fee between $150–300. This covers local event costs (purchasing playing fields, volunteer lunches, and venue fees). Information about these fees comes from the individual leagues."]},{"l":"Season","p":["The FIRST Tech Challenge season begins with a kickoff near the beginning of September and ends with the FIRST Championship event near the end of April. A typical season looks like this:","September: Kickoff, workshop events, and volunteer training","October: Scrimmage events, which do not contribute to ranking or advancement, but provide valuable practice for teams and volunteers","November–January: League Meets events, where teams play matches and accumulate a league ranking","January–February: League Tournament event, where teams play matches and participate in a judging process to earn advancement to the Florida Championship","March: Florida Championship event","April: FIRST Championship event","April–June: Premier Events, which are alternative capstone events around the world","Here in Florida, we traditionally host a live kickoff broadcast for all teams, and invite teams to gather in-person where possible."]},{"l":"What makes it possible","p":["The Florida FIRST Tech Challenge program wouldn't be possible without the help of our incredible volunteers. Thank you."]}],[{"l":"Overview","p":["This section contains information for current and prospective FIRST Tech Challenge teams."]}],[{"l":"Event Types","p":["FIRST Tech Challenge has several different types of events throughout the season. This document outlines the differences between them."]},{"l":"Event Registration","p":["First, a note about event registration: In Florida, teams register for events using Region Manager, which is accessible from the events page.","In order to access Region Manager and register for an event, teams must have paid the yearly FIRST registration fee. It can take several days for a team to appear as \"paid\" and gain access to Region Manager after making payment.","Once a team has access to Region Manager, they still may not be able to register for certain types of events unless they are \"Event Ready\".","The term Event Ready is a term that FIRST uses to describe teams that meet a few important requirements:","They have paid the yearly FIRST registration fee,","There are two coaches registered in the FIRST dashboard, and","Both coaches have consented to, and passed, Youth Protection Program (YPP) screening.","Teams must be Event Ready before they can attend League Meet and League Tournament events.","Coaches should consent to YPP screening as early as possible in the season to avoid registration issues."]},{"l":"Kickoff","p":["Early September • No Matches, No Judging, Just Entertainment • RSVP via Email","Kickoff celebrations are a chance for teams to gather in-person and learn about the new FIRST Tech Challenge game together. Here in Florida, we traditionally host a live stream for all teams that includes the official FIRST video announcing the game and reviewing important updates for the season. The best way to experience this broadcast is at your local league's kickoff gathering!","All current and prospective teams are invited to attend.","Because kickoff occurs before many teams have had a chance to finish registration with FIRST, these events do not require registration via Region Manager. Instead, individual kickoff hosts will ask for RSVP via email or a similar method."]},{"l":"Scrimmages","p":["October • Matches, No Judging • Registration via Region Manager or Email","Some leagues host scrimmage events for teams to test out their designs early in the season. These events are non-ranking, non-advancing events, meaning they have no effect on league rankings or advancement to higher levels of tournament. Most scrimmages are relaxed events — teams can attend without having a working robot — where a field is available for test matches.","Although scrimmages are not officially tied to a league in FIRST's eyes, most scrimmages in Florida invite teams from a particular league for capacity planning purposes.","Teams do not need to complete registration and payment with FIRST to attend a scrimmage, and they do not need to be \"Event Ready\".","If a team has not completed payment with FIRST— and therefore does not have access to Region Manager to complete event registration — they should email their league leaders or the scrimmage host and request to attend."]},{"l":"League Meets","p":["Late October – Early January • \"Event Ready\" Required • Matches, no Judging • Registration via Region Manager","League Meets are ranking events where teams accumulate a league ranking by playing matches. These events do have matches, but do not have structured interviews or other forms of judging.","All teams from a league are invited to each League Meet, however the team capacity may be capped by the host. Teams do not need to attend every League Meet, but are encouraged to.","Teams must be \"Event Ready\" to attend a League Meet event. Registration occurs via Region Manager, and is only open to Event Ready teams."]},{"l":"League Tournament","p":["Late January – Early February • \"Event Ready\" Required • Matches and Judging • Registration via Region Manager","League Tournament events are the capstone events for a league. Here, teams compete in qualification matches and playoff rounds. They also participate in structured interviews to receive judged awards.","All teams from a league are invited to the League Tournament. Teams enter the tournament with league rankings accumulated from prior League Meet events, but teams can attend even if they did not attend any of the prior League Meets.","Teams must be \"Event Ready\" to attend a League Tournament event. Registration occurs via Region Manager, and is only open to Event Ready teams."]},{"l":"Florida Championship","p":["Early March • Advancing Teams • Matches and Judging • Registration via Email","Top teams (according to the advancement model described in Section 4 of the Competition Manual) from each League Tournament receive an invitation to the Florida Championship. This dual-division event features qualification matches, playoff rounds, and judged awards.","Because attendance at this event is determined by advancement from League Tournaments, registration is handled via email after official results are posted from each League Tournament.","Top teams from this event advance to the FIRST Championship event and Premier Events around the world."]}],[{"l":"Overview","p":["This section contains information for current and prospective FIRST Tech Challenge leagues."]}],[{"l":"Dean's List Award","p":["This document contains an overview of the Dean's List Award process for league leaders."]},{"l":"Information for the 2025–2026 season","p":["Timeline:","Date","Note","December 15, 2025","Deadline for nominations from teams.","December 16, 2025","Information about nominations becomes available to the PDP.","January 4–17, 2026","Designated timeframe for Dean's List Interviews across the state.","January 18, 2026","Interview notes are due.","League Tournament","Recognize the nominated students as Dean's List Semi-Finalists","Volunteer express signup:","Interviewers"]},{"l":"General information about the award","p":["Summary from FIRST:","In an effort to recognize the leadership and dedication of FIRST’s most outstanding secondary school students, the Kamen family sponsors an award for selected tenth and eleventh grade students known as the FIRST® Robotics Competition and FIRST® Tech Challenge Dean’s List.","In short:","Coaches nominate up to two students each year","Students must be in 10th or 11th grade","Students participate in interviews","Reviewers select Finalists from around the state","Winners are selected from around the world","Learn More"]},{"l":"Terms used in this document","p":["Any student nominated by their coach is considered a Dean's List Semi-Finalist","Students selected by Florida's Dean's List Reviewers are considered Dean's List Finalists","The top 10 students selected from around the world are considered Dean's List Winners","Volunteers from each league that interview nominees / semi-finalists and provide written notes to enhance the nominations","Volunteers that review nominations and select Dean's List Finalists","Judge Advisor","Program Delivery Partner"]},{"l":"The Short Version","p":["Coaches nominate students","Leagues recruit Dean's List Interviewers","Interviewers interview nominees and submit notes","Leagues recognize nominees at the League Tournament"]},{"l":"Nominations","p":["Coaches can nominate up to two students, in 10th or 11th grade, for the Dean's List Award each year. Nominations have a global deadline set by FIRST. Please encourage coaches to nominate their students. Share the Dean's List Nomination Guide for more information.","We aren't able to see any information about the nominations until after the deadline (usually at noon on the day after the deadline). This includes the count of nominations, or how they are divided among the leagues.","Every nominated student is referred to as a Dean's List Semi-Finalist."]},{"l":"Recruiting Interviewers","p":["Individual leagues recruit Dean's List Interviewers. These volunteers will, in pairs, conduct interviews with the nominated students and provide written notes about the student in the Judging Portal. They do need to be unbiased individuals that are willing to advocate for each of the students, but they do not need to make any decisions about who \"wins\".","Someone interested in volunteering as a Dean’s List Interviewer should do the following:","Review the Dean's List Interviewer Manual","Sign up as a Dean’s List Interviewer at the Florida Dean’s List Interviews event in the FIRST Dashboard","An express signup link is available in the overview panel above","They should ignore the dates listed for the event (more on this later)","Make it known (by emailing me, or having you email me) which league they will interview","Each league needs at least two interviewers. Leagues can share interviewers if someone has sufficient time. Leagues can also recruit additional interviewers to help share the workload."]},{"l":"Conducting Interviews","p":["After the nomination deadline, the PDP will share information about the nominees. Any time after that, interviewers can schedule interviews. Here are the constraints:","Interviews must be conducted during the designated timeframe listed in the overview above.","Interview notes are due by the end of the day on the date listed. It’s a good practice to submit them as soon as possible after each individual interview, for the sake of memory.","Interviews, which are usually performed via video conference, require two interviewers to be present at all times. Nominees may also have a silent observer present.","If a league has more than two interviewers, they may self-organize coverage of interviews however they see fit.","The timeframe is a trade-off between giving Dean's List Interviewers as much time as possible, and giving the Dean’s List Reviewers sufficient time to review the interview notes and select finalists before their deadline."]},{"l":"Recognizing Semi-Finalists","p":["Every nominated student is considered a Semi-Finalist for the Dean’s List Award. Leagues should recognize the Semi-Finalists at their League Tournament event. Some portion of a script (opening or awards) will likely include this.","The PDP may receive physical pins for recognition; if this happens, league leaders will be contacted regarding shipping."]}],[{"l":"Trophy Ordering","p":["This document contains information about ordering League Tournament trophies for league leaders.","FIRST Tech Challenge requests that all events use the official trophy provider, Sports Awards. If you have an existing relationship with a different vendor, or an alternative method for acquiring or making trophies for your League Tournament, please consider the official request and make the best choice for your league. Orders are placed on their website."]},{"l":"Decisions","p":["Ordering trophies requires a few important decisions. Below are some recommendations, but league leaders are entrusted to make the best choices for their league (and budget).","Armed with these decisions, you're ready to order."]},{"l":"Do you want the option of giving a Judges' Choice Award?","p":["This trophy is not included in the default “kit” (more information below).","It is recommended to order a trophy for this award so that your JA / Judges have the option, even if they ultimately choose not to give the award. As a reminder, in terms of advancement points, the Judges’ Choice Award is worth just as much as other awards."]},{"l":"Do you want to give a Volunteer of the Year award?","p":["This plaque is not included in the default \"kit\". This award can be given at your league leadership’s discretion, and does not require the involvement of the judge crew.","It is recommended to order a plaque for this award if your leadership committee is comfortable nominating and choosing a Volunteer of the Year from your league."]},{"l":"Do you want to give out medals for the robot game winners?","p":["The “kit” only includes medals for the Inspire Award winner.","If you want to give out individual medals for members of the winning alliance, consider ordering 20 (average 10 per team). If a team needs more, leagues can order additional medals after the event."]},{"l":"Do you want to engrave the event name, season, or award on the medals?","p":["By default, medals are completely blank except for a generic FIRST Tech Challenge logo — no indication of the event, the season, or the award. Engraving is $0.75 each.","It is recommended to engrave your (shortened) event name and “Inspire Award 2025–26” or “Winning Alliance 2025–26” as appropriate."]},{"l":"Make the Order","p":["Create an account on https://ftc.firstinspiresawards.com/ to get started.
